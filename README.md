# 95th Percentile Bandwidth Limiter

A script to dynamically manage network traffic based on **95th percentile bandwidth limiting**. It enforces compliance with provider contracts by monitoring traffic patterns, supporting **1:2 burst configurations**, and applying intelligent bandwidth limits to prevent overuse and ensure smooth operations.


## Key Features 

- **Dynamic Limiting**: Automatically limits bandwidth to **498 Mbps (1:2 burst)** when usage exceeds **500 Mbps** for 3 consecutive minutes.
- **Time-Based Exceptions**: Skips limiting during peak hours (**19:00â€“23:00**).
- **Daily Reset**: Resets all data points and limits at midnight.
- **Daily Monitoring**: Caps bandwidth for the remainder of the day if usage exceeds **500 Mbps** for more than **70 out of 1440 minutes**.
  

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Save the Script
Save the provided script to your system, for example, as `/root/bandwidth_control.sh`.

Ensure the script has executable permissions:
```bash
chmod +x /root/bandwidth_control.sh
```



### 2. Create a Systemd Service
To run the script automatically and ensure it stays active, create a systemd service file at `/etc/systemd/system/bandwidth_control.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Bandwidth Control Service
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/bin/bash /root/bandwidth_control.sh
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```



### 3. Start the Service
Reload systemd to recognize the new service:
```bash
systemctl daemon-reload
```

Enable the service to start at boot:
```bash
systemctl enable bandwidth_control.service
```

Start the service:
```bash
systemctl start bandwidth_control.service
```



### 4. Verify the Service
To check the service status and ensure it's running:
```bash
systemctl status bandwidth_control.service
```

To stop or restart the service:
```bash
systemctl stop bandwidth_control.service
systemctl restart bandwidth_control.service
```



### 5. Configure Log Rotation for Debug Logs
To manage debug logs and prevent disk space issues, create a log rotation configuration file at `/etc/logrotate.d/bandwidth_debug`:

```ini
/var/log/bandwidth_debug.log {
    daily
    rotate 7
    compress
    missingok
    notifempty
    size 50M
    create 644 root root
}
```



## Logs and Debugging

### Debug Logs
For real-time debugging:
```bash
tail -f /var/log/bandwidth_debug.log
```

### Bandwidth Usage Logs
Check captured bandwidth usage data:
```bash
cat /var/log/bandwidth_usage.log
```

### Bandwidth Control Logs
Review applied limits and actions:
```bash
cat /var/log/bandwidth_control.log
```
